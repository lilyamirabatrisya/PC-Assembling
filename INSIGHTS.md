# PC Disassembly & Assembly Experience  
**Date:** 12 November 2025
**Venue:** N28, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor

## Overview  
On November 12th, my teammates and I were taught how to disassemble and assemble a PC. This was my first time seeing the internal components of a computer up close. I had never seen the inside of a PC before, and experiencing it firsthand showed me that the process wasn’t as difficult as I expected. However, the components proved to be very fragile, requiring extra care. Otherwise, the PC wouldn't turn on after reassembly. With guidance from our lecturers, we successfully took the PC apart and put it all back together into one piece.

## Challenges & Learning Moments  
During the class, we made a small mistake. We didn’t recheck whether all components were securely placed before submitting our work. As a result, the PC wouldn’t run because one internal piece wasn't correctly seated. This led to a mark deduction and taught us that we can never be too careful. Since then, my teammates and I always double-check our final work before submission.

Another key lesson was learning to **never be shy about asking for help**. As a student, I've often felt embarrassed to raise my hand when everyone else seemed to know what they were doing. However,  I was too scared of taking the risk to damage the PC from any avoidable mistakes. So, I kept asking questions until everything was crystal clear to me.

## Key Takeaways  
- PC assembly is more accessible than it seems, but requires attention to detail  
- Components are fragile and have to be handled with extreme care  
- Always recheck your work before finalizing and submitting
- Asking questions is essential for clarity and preventing errors  
- Teamwork and clear communication enhance learning and outcomes

## Reflection  
This was an amazing hands-on experience that demonstrate the computer hardware and emphasized the importance of caution, verification, and the courage to ask questions. It boosted both my technical confidence and my willingness to seek guidance in learning environments.
